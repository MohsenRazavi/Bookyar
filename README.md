# Bookyar
a djnago based project which helps peaple to exchange thier books

As this project is based on python it is better to create a virtual environment after cloning codes .

python -m venv some_name

then acitve it . 

.\some_name\Scripts\activate

then you need to have project requirements :

pip install -r requirements.txt

after that run this command in your root directory : 

python manage.py runserver

in your browser enter 127.0.0.1:8000

note : project is on until runserver command is running
